The checklist follows the references.  Please
read the checklist guidelines carefully for information on how to answer these
questions.  For each question, change the default \answerTODO{} to \answerYes{},
\answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.  You are strongly encouraged to include a {\bf
justification to your answer}, either by referencing the appropriate section of
your paper or providing a brief inline description.  For example:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Did you include the license to the code and datasets? \answerYes{See Section~\ref{gen_inst}.}
  \item Did you include the license to the code and datasets? \answerNo{The code and the data are proprietary.}
  \item Did you include the license to the code and datasets? \answerNA{}
\end{itemize}
Please do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your
answers.  Note that the Checklist section does not count towards the page
