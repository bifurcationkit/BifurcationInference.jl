    \answerYes{}
  \item Did you describe the limitations of your work?
    \answerYes{Implementation only covers co-dimension one bifurcations. Does not scale well for PDEs. See discussion in Section \ref{}}

    \answerNA{}
  \item Have you read the ethics review guidelines and ensured that your paper conforms to them?
    \answerYes{}
\end{enumerate}

\item If you are including theoretical results...
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Did you state the full set of assumptions of all theoretical results?
    \answerNA{This paper applies existing theorems. See Section \ref{section:method}}
	\item Did you include complete proofs of all theoretical results?
    \answerNA{We include derivations to guide the reader in Appendices}
\end{enumerate}

\item If you ran experiments...
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Did you include the code, data, and instructions needed to reproduce the main experimental results (either in the supplemental material or as a URL)?
    \answerYes{All figures are unit tests in the GitHub repository for \texttt{BifurcationFit.jl}}
  \item Did you specify all the training details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen)?
    \answerYes{ADAM was used with various hyper-parameters}
	\item Did you report error bars (e.g., with respect to the random seed after running experiments multiple times)?
    \answerYes{See Figure \ref{fig:scaling} and }
	\item Did you include the total amount of compute and the type of resources used (e.g., type of GPUs, internal cluster, or cloud provider)?
    \answerYes{See Figure \ref{fig:scaling}}
\end{enumerate}
